### Notes
- The script files are largely based on the sample codes distributed for the assignments during the lecture.
- Raw data files are missing(due to capacity limit in Github), but you can see what the outputs were in ipynb files.
## What each scripts do
- 1_notmnist.ipynb
  - handwritten digit classification using logistic regression(softmax).
- 2_fullyconnected.ipynb
  - handwritten digit classification using basic ANN + ReLU
- 3_regularization.ipynb
  - handwritten digit classification using vanilla ANN + ReLU + regularization + dropout
- 4_convolutions.ipynb
  - handwritten digit classification using Convolutional Neural Network
- 5_word2vec.ipynb
  - word2vec model(word embeddings)
- 6_lstm.ipynb
  - the famous RNN model for dealing with sequences.
